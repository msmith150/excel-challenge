 Crowdfunding Analysis using excel.  

 Using an Excel workbook, I modified and analyzed sample-project data in an attempt to uncover market trends through the following steps:

- Used conditional formatting to fill each cell in the outcome column with a different color, depending on whether the associated campaign was successful, failed, canceled, or is currently live.

- Created a new column called Percent Funded that uses a formula to find how much money a campaign made relative to its initial funding goal.

- Used conditional formatting to fill each cell in the Percent Funded column according to a three-color scale. 

- Created a new column called Average Donation that uses a formula to find how much each project backer paid on average.

- Created two new columns, one called Parent Category and another called Sub-Category, that use formulas to split the Category and Sub-Category column into the two new, separate columns.

- Created a new sheet with a pivot table that analyzes your initial worksheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or are currently live per category.

- Created a stacked-column pivot chart that can be filtered by country based on the table created.

- Created a new sheet with a pivot table that analyzes the initial sheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, or canceled, or are currently live per sub-category.

- Created a stacked-column pivot chart that can be filtered by country and parent category based on the table created.

- Created a new column named Date Created Conversion which uses a formula to convert the data contained in launched_at into Excel's date format.

- Created a new column named Date Ended Conversion which uses a formula to convert the data contained in deadline into Excel's date format.

- Created a new sheet with a pivot table that has a column of outcome, rows of Date Created Conversion, values based on the count of outcome, and filters based on parent category and Years.

- Created a pivot-chart line graph that visualizes this new table.

- Created a report in Microsoft Word highlighting conclusions and limitations of the dataset.
